    "- Follow the prompts to install the extension. Once it is installed, you will see the MetaMask icon appear in the top right corner of your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click on the MetaMask icon to open the extension. After you agree to their terms, you will be prompted to create a new wallet or import an existing one. For this lab, we will create a new wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click \"Create a Wallet\". You will be asked to create a password for your wallet. Choose a strong, unique password and make sure to remember it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MetaMask will then generate a \"secret recovery phrase\" for you. This phrase is a series of words that can be used to restore your wallet if you ever lose access to it. It is important to keep this safe and secure, as anyone who has access to it will be able to access your wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write down the phrase and store it in a safe place. You will be asked to confirm that you have written it down by selecting the words in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you have written down and confirmed your seed phrase, you will be taken to the main MetaMask screen. Here, you will see your \"account address\", which is a long hexadecimal string that serves as your unique wallet address. This is the address that you will use to receive tokens."
